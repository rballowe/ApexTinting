			<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

			<details>
			<summary>What is the difference between carbon and ceramic tint?</summary>
			<dd> Carbon window tint contains carbon particles that help to absorb and disperse heat.
			Carbon is a great option to help reduce the amount of light and heat that enters the vehicle, 
			but only offers moderate UV protection.  In addition, carbon tint more affordable than ceramic.<br>
			<br>Ceramic tint has non-metal, nano-ceramic particles, which is more effective at blocking heat
			and UV rays.  Cermaic blocks a higher percentage of UV rays, allowing for even more cooling
			of one's vehicle.  Although ceramic is more expensive, it does provide excellent clarity and 
			non-reflective appearance. </dd>
			</details>
			<br><br>
			<details>
			<summary>How long does it take for my tint to be attached?</summary>
			<dd> It depends on customer needs and preference.  For example a small to mid sized car could take
			anywhere from 2 to 2.5 hours.   Larger vehicles can take anywhere from 2.5 to 3.5 hours.  Time is also
			dependednt upon whether the customer wants the entire car tinted, or just a single window.   In addition,
			services can take longer if there is previous tint that needs to be removed first.  Please

			<summary>What is the AZ law for window tint?</summary>
			<dd> The law states that you can have tint on your windows but under specific guidelines. 
			AZ law permits non-reflective tint ont he top 5 inches of the windshield.  
			Tint on the front and side windows must allow at least 33% of visible light to pass 
			through.  Rear and side windows have no restrictions. <br><br>
			AZ law also allows for medical exceptions, which would be offer darker tint.  You can 
			review the <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/ars/28/00959-01.htm" class="custom-link"> law </a>here, along with details for the

			<br><br>
			<details>
			<summary>What is the difference between the percentages?</summary>
			<dd> The term "perentage" in the context of window tinting describes the amount of light that can
			pass through the tint.  A lower percentage indicates a darker tint, while a higher percentage
			results in a higher tint.  For instance, 5% represents the darkest possible tint, while 70% is the lightest.
			<br><br> It's important to note that as the tint percentage increases, the effectiveness of UV protection decreases. </dd>
			</details>

			<details>
			<summary>Is there anything special I need to do for my tint after it has been applied?</summary>
			<dd> <strong>Let it Cure:</strong> The tint needs time to cure and it can take 2-4 days.  During this time, avoid 
			rolling down the window as it can cause damage</dd><br>
			<dd> <strong>Cleaning:</strong>  Use a gentle cleaner and a non-abrasive sponge.</dd><br>
			<dd> <strong> Damages:</strong>  If you notice any scratches or damages to the tint, contact us to make necessary repairs.</dd><br>

			to provide the UV protection and enhanced privacy benefits you desire. </dd>
